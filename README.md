# UrlShortener
URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL.

 An URL shortener ensures that you get the right messages out to your audience without taking up too much space in your social posts.
 
 Make it easier to share your content: Some link shorteners let you create a branded URL containing your brand. Simplified and branded URLs tell customers everything they need to know about your site. There’s no need to use reduced URLs with random combinations of letters and numbers anymore. For example, you may have seen long URLs on Amazon shortened to a branded URL like: https://amzn.to/3q1xugs
 
Allows for traffic monitoring: Bit.ly comes with tracking monitors that measure the sharing activities of your tweet or post over a certain period. Most link shorteners also let you track engagement with UTM parameters. They track who, where and when someone clicked your link so you can measure its effectiveness. Businesses need to know the ROI of campaigns to adjust and plan for future campaigns. You can also combine UTM parameters with Google Analytics to get a complete picture of behavior.

Make your URLs more appealing: Shorter URLs have more aesthetic appeal. Although this might not seem important, a shorter URL could make all the difference in convincing someone to click on your links. You may find yourself dealing with a long URL if you’re linking to a page buried deep within your website or using UTM parameters to track your visitors. Long URLs can also look a bit suspicious with letters, numbers, backslashes and question marks. So people might be reluctant to click the link: http://yourwebsite.com/your-page/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=PPC&utm_ But a link shortener keeps things looking clean and trustworthy.
